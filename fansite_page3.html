       <p>It started on the beach in Miami. I was doing my morning yoga practice. 
         <p>I noticed so much more trash than usual. So it bothered me and I started picking it. One day, led to the next and it became a habit, a meditation. 
           Clean the beach, clean the mind. Along with stretch and breath. I started documenting my "daily trash catch". 
           Do you know what items were most common? Straws, plastic utencils, so many flip flops! I know! Weird! I even found needles and many plastic toys. 
           Then I started looking in the net about single use plastic. That led to organizing cleaning events with friends. 
           </p>
           But the biggest epiphany was...one night coming to the term ZERO WASTE online. Genious! A creative French mom invented the whole concept. 
           Not that the idea wasn't out there. But she really went for it. So after her TED talk I was changed. I will leave a link to it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUmo-40pqA">here</a>. 
           Zero waste is not about buying expensive eco alternatives. It is a lifestyle. And it is minimalism, creativity and humbling experience to help the planet and us!

           <li>We started by only purchasing food in bulk like quinoa, beans, nuts.</li>
           <li>Same for veggies and fruits, using reusable bags.</li>
           <li>Glass jars have so many uses. </li>
           <li>Slowly transitioned into refillable soap, laundry detergent, shampoo, cleaning supplies, 
             all thanks to the local store in Miami, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/verde_market">Verde Market</a>.
            </li>
           <li>Natural cosmetics, no toxins.
           </li>
           <li>Fast fashion is a big polluter, so second hand, eco fabrics.
           </li>
           <li>Any effort counts, no one is perfect.
           </li>
           <li>Overall spending less as we buy less. Experience over gifts.
           </li>
        <div> <p>If any of that inspired you engage and explore to leave Earth better than we found it! </p></div>
